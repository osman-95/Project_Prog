```

The **Content file** contains all the necessary folder, packages and codes required for the implementation of the model
- It contains the image folder required for training and evaluation 
- Weights required to initiate the training 
- The configuration file of the model which is used to tune various parameters in the model like
   - The number of steps 
   - batch size
- The folder that saves checkpoints of the training
- Output folder that stores the results of the evalution

The **Output file** consists of a copy of the results obtained from the evaluation process. The results obtained is in the following format:
- image
- video

The **Yolo.ipynb** is the note book containing the complete code required to train an evalute the model.

## Description of the model

The pretrained model use was obtained from [experiencor](https://github.com/experiencor). The model was trained on a kitchen [dataset]() extracted from [indoor scene dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/itsahmad/indoor-scenes-cvpr-2019) from kaggle.The extracted dataset consisted of 300 images labelled with four labels
- oven
- kitchen sink
- refrigerator
- Range Hood

The data was labelled manually using [VoTT](https://github.com/microsoft/VoTT) software to label all the annotation of the images. The annotaion file generated by VoTT was in Pascal format (xml file) and was converted into Yolo format using the [xml to yolo formt converter]() code. This code convert the xml files to a csv list that is compatible with the pretrained yolo model. 

The data was trained with a pretrained [weights]() to get better results and save training time. The weights were obtained from [Darknet](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/).

The data was trained for 1000 steps with batch size of 16 and threshhold accuracy of 0.65. The tarining process took about 8 hours and the results is shown below
